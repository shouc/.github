### :briefcase: Mantle Ecosystem

Mantle Network is a technology stack for scaling Ethereum, and we strive to be EVM-compatible while doing so. Being EVM-compatible means all the contracts and tools that work on Ethereum also work on Mantle Network with minimal modifications. Users can experiment with exciting web3 apps, and developers can deploy smart contracts in an efficient, low-fee environment.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **High**          | Issues that are highly exploitable security vulnerabilities. It may cause direct loss of funds / permanent freezing of funds. All high severity issues should be resolved.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Medium**        | Issues that are only exploitable under some conditions or with some privileged access to the system. Users’ yields/rewards/information is at risk. All medium severity issues should be resolved unless there is a clear reason not to.                                                                      |
| **Low**           | Issues that are low risk. Not fixing those issues will not result in the failure of the system. A fix on low severity issues is recommended but subject to the clients’ decisions.                                                                                                                           |
| **Informational** | Issues that pose no risk to the system and are related to the security best practices. Not fixing those issues will not result in the failure of the system.

## Disclaimer

Verilog Solutions receives compensation from one or more clients for performing the smart contract and auditing analysis contained in these reports. The report created is solely for Clients and published with their consent. As such, the scope of our audit is limited to a review of code, and only the code we note as being within the scope of our audit is detailed in this report. It is important to note that the Solidity code itself presents unique and unquantifiable risks since the Solidity language itself remains under current development and is subject to unknown risks and flaws. Our sole goal is to help reduce the attack vectors and the high level of variance associated with utilizing new and consistently changing technologies. Thus, Verilog Solutions in no way claims any guarantee of the security or functionality of the technology we agree to analyze.

In addition, Verilog Solutions reports do not provide any indication of the technologies' proprietors, business, business model, or legal compliance. As such, reports do not provide investment advice and should not be used to make decisions about investment or involvement with any particular project. Verilog Solutions has the right to distribute the Report through other means, including via Verilog Solutions publications and other distributions. Verilog Solutions makes the reports available to parties other than the Clients (i.e., “third parties”) – on its website in hopes that it can help the blockchain ecosystem develop technical best practices in this rapidly evolving area of innovation.
